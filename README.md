1.Project description
The project involves setting up a virtual environment using the modern package manager UV, performing data analysis and visualization using pandas and matplotlib, and presenting the results through both Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts. And version control is handled via Git and GitHub.

2.Virtual environment setup instructions
The following is the method for Windows users:
Use uv (need to download and install in advance), create a virtual environment and use
uv venv --python 3.12
Set-ExecutionPolicy-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Download the package used by the project in advance
uv pip install pandas matplotlib ipykernel jupyter

Create the kernel used when using jupyter
python-m ipykernel install --user--name=business-analysis --display-name="Business Analysis (UV)"

3.How to run the analysis
Use tools that can run Python, such as jupyter notebook, vs code, colab, etc.
Make sure UNRATE.csv is in the same directory as the code.

4.Key findings from your analysis
(1) The data shape is (928, 2) (the two columns are observation_date and UNRATE).
(2) Overall average unemployment rate: 5.68%. The lowest value is 2.5% (May 1, 1953 and June 1, 1953), the highest value is 14.8% (June 1, 2020), and most of them are in the range of 4.3-6.7%.
(3) The data spans from decade 1940 to 2020, and the maximum average unemployment rate of 9.7% occurred in 1982.
(4) During the 2008 financial crisis, the average unemployment rate was 7.54%, the highest was 10%, and most of the unemployment rates were between 5.75-9.5%. During the COVID 19 pandemic, the average unemployment rate was 5.7%, which was lower than the financial crisis, but the highest was 14.8%(higher than 2008), and most of the unemployment rates were between 3.6-6.48%.
(5) The most stable unemployment rates occurred in the 1990s, with a standard deviation of 1.0492944808598896.
(6) In the past decade, the unemployment rate slowly declined from 2015 to 2019, and then rose sharply due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching a peak of 8 in 2020, and then fell sharply to 2022 and then slowly rose again.
(7) The unemployment rate changes with the economic cycle, and there is a peak and trough cycle about once every ten years.

5.Data source attribution
Data provided by professors for class assignments.

6.GenAI usage acknowledgment (if applicable)
In the Find minimum and maximum unemployment rates with their dates section, use Chatgpt to generate output and loops that print all dates.
prompt:I want a loop to output all the dates, which are stored in min_dates.
